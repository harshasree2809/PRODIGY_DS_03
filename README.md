## 🌳 Decision Tree Classifier for Customer Purchase Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on building a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data.

## 📌 Overview

The project aims to:
- Use the **Bank Marketing dataset** from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Train a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict customer purchases.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

## 🔗 Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**:
[Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing)

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repository and open the Jupyter Notebook (`task 3.ipynb`).
2. Load the dataset and preprocess it (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, etc.).
3. Train the **Decision Tree Classifier**.
4. Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Experiment with hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model.

## 📊 Machine Learning Workflow
- **Step 1**: Data loading and exploration.
- **Step 2**: Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Step 3**: Feature selection and engineering.
- **Step 4**: Model training using a Decision Tree Classifier.
- **Step 5**: Model evaluation and performance analysis.
- **Step 6**: Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning model implementation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment.
